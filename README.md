# Credit-Card-Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting credit card approvals using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook and aims to provide insights into the factors that influence credit card approval decisions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a credit card application will be approved or not based on various applicant features. This can help financial institutions streamline their approval process and reduce the risk of approving fraudulent or risky applications.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the data distribution and relationships.
- Model Building: Training and evaluating various machine learning models.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
